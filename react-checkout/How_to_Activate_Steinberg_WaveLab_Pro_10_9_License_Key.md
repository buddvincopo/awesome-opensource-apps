## What is an Activation Code?
 
An Activation Code is a unique code that allows you to download and activate your license for Steinberg WaveLab Pro 10 9. You can obtain an Activation Code in different ways, depending on how you purchased your software:
 
- If you have received your Steinberg software in a box, it includes a Download Access Code printed on a sheet (Essential Product License Information). When redeeming the Download Access Code in the Steinberg Download Assistant, an Activation Code will be automatically generated and used to download and activate your license.
- If you have purchased your software as download from the online shop, you will receive a confirmation email. Depending on the product, the email includes the Activation Code or a Download Access Code. When redeeming the Download Access Code in the Steinberg Download Assistant, an Activation Code will be automatically generated and used to download and activate your license.
- If you have performed a Reactivation in your MySteinberg account, an Activation Code will be sent to you by email. Reactivation is necessary if you need to activate a new installation of your software - for example, after you have switched to a new computer or reinstalled your operating system.
- If you have installed a legacy version of Cubase LE, Cubase AI or WaveLab LE (4, 5 or 6), a demo license limited in time will be created. An Activation Code for a permanent license can be obtained by registering the software online in your MySteinberg account.

## How to use an Activation Code?
 
The following instructions outline the activation process by using an Activation Code in the eLicenser Control Center - a utility that allows for managing music software licenses by a variety of manufacturers. The eLicenser Control Center will be installed along automatically with your Steinberg software.

1. Install your Steinberg WaveLab Pro 10 9 software.
2. Install the latest update if available in the Steinberg Download Assistant or on the download pages. Some installers allow for including updates during the installation.

4. Apply the 'Maintenance & Online Synchronisation' by clicking on 'Perform Maintenance Tasks' (or click on the 'Maintenance' button at the top right if not shown).
5. Enter your Activation Code in the field provided and click on 'Continue'.
6. Select either a Soft-eLicenser (virtual license container on hard disk) or a USB-eLicenser (dongle, license key) to store your license on and click on 'Download License'.
7. Wait until the download process is completed and close the eLicenser Control Center.
